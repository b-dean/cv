# Ben Dean's CV repo
This is a repo where I plan to put a digital copy of my CV in the github pages.

View it live: https://b-dean.github.io/cv/

## Usage
If you want to run this locally, just do

```shell
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

And then go to http://localhost:4000

## Misc
Here's some things I found useful making this CV:

- [Carolyn Stransky's blog post about making a digital CV](https://workwithcarolyn.com/blog/digital-cv-guide).

    I also referenced the [raw markdown of her CV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carolstran/cv/main/README.md)
    for examples of how to format various sections.

- The GitHub Docs on [creating](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
  and [testing](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll)
  GitHub Pages sites with Jekyll.
- [The Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)

Also I feel like I should give credit for the `favicon.ico` which I got [from freefavicon.com](https://freefavicon.com/freefavicons/software/iconinfo/iconconsole-152-22674.html).
