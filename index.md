## Technical Experience

**Senior Software Engineer** @ [Finvi] (formerly known as Ontario Systems) _(2008 - Present)_

`Jan 2012 - Present` - Various "DevOps" teams and projects

Starting around the beginning of 2012 I joined a team whose goal was to automate the build, deployment, and infrastructure of new software products.
This started with deploying systems to private hosted environments (VMWare) and transitioned over time to deploy system to public cloud services (AWS).
There are a number of technologies and tools used some dating back to that initial work in 2012.

- [Jenkins] - build server
- [Chef] - configuration management and automated software provisioning
- [Terraform] - infrastructure automation
- [Packer] - building images to deploy in AWS
- [Docker] - building containerized applications
- [Kubernetes] - cluster for running containerized microservices
- [Helm] - deploying software releases to Kubernetes

In addition to the "devops" work, our team was often tasked with various side projects. Some notable projects are:

- Web app to organize product install and upgrade testing across multiple combinations of versions and supported platforms.
- Simple artifact repository with additional APIs to support various needs of our software.
- Web app to track delivery of software products to premise customers.
- CLI for launching containerized versions of [InterSystems] Cach√©/Ensemble/IRIS products in Docker.
- Web app and auto-updating framework for downloading and updating various in-house tools.

`Jan 2009 - Dec 2011` - Large scale .NET-based enterprise web application built on top of Microsoft Dynamics CRM and hosted in IIS 7.

- As a member of tools/build team I was responsible for understanding the system architecture and providing utility programs, libraries, and installers that enable the rest of the team to be productive and deliver a cohesive, working product.
- The tecnologies used in this product include .NET 3.5, Microsoft Dynamics CRM, SharePoint, IIS 7, C#, WCF, WF, Silverlight, SQL Server, WiX, T4 Code Generation, MSTest, and Rhino.Mocks.
- Microsoft Team Foundation Server was used as a source control repository and task tracking system.

`Sept 2008 - Dec 2008` - Large scale java-based enterprise web application using the Spring Framework and hosted on the JBoss Application Server.

- On this product I worked on a team responsible for providing the framework code that connected the entire application. We used Spring's Inversion of Control framework to wire together the different parts of the larger web application.
- The technologies used in this product include Java 6, Spring, JBoss, Hibernate, JMS, CXF, JUnit, and EasyMock.
- Subversion was used for version control and Maven was used to manage software artifacts.
